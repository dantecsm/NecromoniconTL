  {
    "message": "Even though the door kept its original shape despite definitely showing signs of burning, why the hell is the inside of the room in such a terrible state？"
  },
  {
    "message": "Various relics are scattered across the floor."
  },
  {
    "message": "Apparently, it wasn't just a storage-like room, but a room that must have served some important purpose."
  },
  {
    "message": "There are cracks in the wall, like the remnants of a hole big enough for a tall person to walk through without ducking."
  },
  {
    "message": "Maybe it's because of the fire, but cracks run from the floor to the ceiling, and in places the plaster is peeling off."
  },
  {
    "message": "It's kind of weird, like there was an entrance carved into the wall, with cracks in the shape of a doorway."
  },
  {
    "message": "Seeing that it's stained black and dirty just like the other parts, it probably isn't a hole that was patched up later, but I can't believe it's just a coincidence either."

  {
    "message": "It looks like the mortar wall is starting to give way under the weight of the ceiling."
  },
  {
    "message": "Judging by the direction, the other side of this wall is inside the dirt, so it's hard to imagine there's some kind of hidden room ahead."

    "message": "The crack in the ceiling feels ominous."
  },
  {

    "message": "Just thinking about the heavy stone-covered ground above this ceiling sends chills down my spine."
  },
  {
    "message": "Since it's been left abandoned for over 100 years after the fire, it wouldn't be weird if it collapsed at any moment."
  },
  {
    "message": "Plaster peeled off the wall is piled up on the floor."

    "message": "The white fragments, probably peeled from where cracks formed in the wall, look like pieces of broken ceramics."

  },
  {
    "message": "The cover made of tanned and dyed leather is scorched in places, to the point where even the title can't be read."
  },
  {
    "message": "It looks like it's from a time when printing technology wasn't common and books were expensive, and inside, it's a handwritten manuscript. Maybe a devoted Nun carefully copied it all by hand."
  },
  {
    "message": "It seems to be written in Latin, but there are so many burn marks and smudges that I can barely read it."
  },
  {
    "message": "If only I'd thrown myself into language studies more seriously back in my student days......"
  },
  {
    "message": "Since it's in the Monastery, it's probably a Bible or something, but it's weird that just this one book happened to survive the fire."
  },
  {
    "message": "I don't really think it's worth much."
  },
  {
    "message": "I put the book back on the floor."
  },
  {
    "message": "It looks like experimental equipment made of melted glass."
  },
  {
    "message": "I have no idea why something like this is lying around in the Monastery's basement."
  },
  {
    "message": "It's a melted glass bottle."
  },
  {
    "message": "It's shaped like a beaker used in scientific experiments."
  },
  {
    "message": "Why is something like this in the Monastery's basement？"
  },
  {
    "message": "I picked up the glass bottle that had melted, leaving only the bottom part."
  },
  {
    "message": "The glass, which melted from the heat and then solidified again, has deformed into a strange, shapeless form like water spilled on the floor."
  },
  {
    "message": "I wonder who used something like this."
  },
  {
    "message": "A Nun secretly sitting in a basement with experimental equipment goes way beyond anything I could imagine."
  },
  {
    "message": "Looking at the floor, there's a huge amount of glass that's melted and doesn't have its original shape at all."
  },
  {
    "message": "Weren't there a lot of other glass instruments too?"
  },
  {
    "message": "So this room was a Laboratory？"
  },
