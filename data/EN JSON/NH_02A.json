  },
  {
    "message": "Inside the hut, which looked like an abandoned house, the atmosphere was so dark and creepy that it wouldn't be surprising if someone was lurking in the shadows. I really didn't want to stay there for long."
  },
  {
    "message": "The machines covering one whole wall, the likes of which I've never seen anywhere else, are so antiquated that you could easily believe they were made at the very beginning of the Industrial Revolution."
  },
  {
    "message": "This is the refinery that Dunwich used to use."
  },
  {
    "message": "There’s a roof and the place is surrounded by walls on all sides, so it kind of still looks like a factory, but the doors are busted and there are holes here and there in the walls."

    "message": "If it was just for purification, you wouldn't need such a huge setup."
  },
  {
    "message": "The machines, dirty with soot and showing spots of rust, at least on the surface, still look like they might work if someone just did some maintenance."
  },
  {
    "message": "It's a huge contraption, kind of like a boiler."
  },
  {
    "message": "I don't really get how it works, but if it's just for purifying gold, there shouldn't be any need for something this complicated."
  },

    "message": "If he just wanted to refine gold, it would be enough to melt impure gold and burn off the impurities."

    "message": "The room on the second floor of the Dunwich Mansion that looked like a scientist’s laboratory might have been where Philip was researching how to turn the gold-like metal he got into real gold."
  },
  {
    "message": "These machines, whose purpose I don't understand, were probably specially made just for that."
  },
  {
    "message": "Because the door's been broken, besides dust, fine sand and dead plant leaves have piled up on the floor."
  },
  {
    "message": "Even if there was someone who took an interest in this Hut, it must've been a really long time since anyone last set foot inside."

  },

    "message": "Even if Philip Dunwich left something behind, it would have been taken away long ago."

    "message": "It's obvious that no one has been in the Hut for a really long time."
  },
  {
    "message": "It's an entrance that leads to a room like the office next door."
  },
  {
    "message": "When we came here before, Thomas, blinded by greed, broke it by force, so of course it's not locked."
  },
  {

    "message": "That means it was something put on by someone later..."
  },
  {
    "message": "By that time, I guess my savings were already running dry."
  },
  {
    "message": "But the fact that they still intended to use the Hut, does that mean they had some prospect of getting new money from somewhere?"
  },
  {
    "message": "I can't imagine Dollie, the scholarly type, having the knack of a wheeler-dealer, so maybe it was someone outside the Dunwich family who did it."
  },
  {
    "message": "A dust-covered light bulb, probably too old to even work now, is hanging down. Seems like someone other than the Dunwich family was trying to use this refinery."
  },
  {
    "message": "It's shabbily built, like it was thrown together from scrap wood."

    "message": "This shadiness is like the underground distilleries that were common back in the day when alcohol was heavily taxed."
