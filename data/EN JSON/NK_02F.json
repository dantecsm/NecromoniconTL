  },
  {
    "message": "Photography already existed in Dollie's time, and I can't see him as a man with such a strong desire for attention that he'd go out of his way to have a portrait painted."
  },
  {
    "message": "On the other hand, if it's something from a way previous head of the family, it doesn't make sense for there to be just one piece. There should be paintings of all the successive heads lined up."
  },

    "message": "If I think about it as Dollie hanging up this painting here to get a sense of the father who disappeared before she was born, that makes the most sense."
