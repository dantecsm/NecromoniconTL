    "message": "But the kind of despicable bastards who could do this with a straight face shouldn’t exist in this world anymore."

    "message": "The villagers must have hidden the stairs leading to the basement behind someone else’s face and just quickly forgotten about it."
  },
  {
    "message": "The old coffin is shabbily made and looks downright cheap, and there's not even a name under the Cross to say who's buried inside."
  },
  {
    "message": "The blood oozing out from the corpse inside the thin coffin had turned into a dark, nasty stain, soaking right into the flimsy wooden boards; it felt way more real and raw than those pure white skulls lined up in the Ossuary."

    "message": "I wonder what the corpses left lying around here think about this unfair treatment."
  },

    "message": "Even if those thin boards, nailed down just now, suddenly burst open and started complaining about how badly they've been treated, I wouldn't be surprised at all."

    "name": "Jonathan",
    "message": "Whoever did this must have found it really inconvenient.　　　　　　　I bet the last thing on their mind was giving it a proper burial."
  },

    "message": "Without being buried in the soil, it's just left to rot in the damp basement."
  },
  {
    "message": "On the surface of the thin board, filthy fluids brought on by blood and decay had seeped in, leaving distinctly dark, dirty stains."

    "message": "No one would see something like this and not feel disgusted."
  },
  {
    "message": "That feeling comes not so much from being shown something filthy, but from anger at the existence of despicable bastards who trample on the dignity of the dead."

    "message": "The coffin lid, warped from the humidity, is almost rotting away, and it looks like it would snap easily if you pressed on it even a little hard."
  },
  {
    "message": "The lid of the coffin, carelessly nailed shut, is warped out of shape from the damp, and you can peek inside just by lifting it a little with your fingers."

  {
    "message": "I don't particularly want to see it, but it's not like I'm not curious about what kind of person is buried in the coffin."
